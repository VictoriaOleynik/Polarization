### The story about polarization in the European Parliament

## Multidimensional Polarization Index with Weighted Distances
1. Model
  Suppose, we are given a society split into n groups according to particular criteria. Assume there exist attributes, or features of society that create similarities and differences between individuals, and, consequently, groups of individuals. 
Each group is described by a number  and a vector  in a multidimensional space,  where  is a number of attributes describing the society under consideration. A number  corresponds to the share of group’s members in the whole society, . For the sake of simplicity, thereafter we assume that each of  attributes can be presented as a value of some scalar variable taking value from the interval . For instance, consider ideological “leftists – rightists” scale where 0 corresponds to extreme leftists and 1 – to extreme rightists, respectively. Thus, , is a point in the multidimensional cube representing positions of the group in respective dimensions.
Hence, each group may be seen as a weighted point in the multidimensional unit cube; together all the groups form a system of weighted points. 
Let us now define a center of mass  of the system of points 
, in which weights  are concentrated respectively, as 
Then, the multidimensional polarization index of a society under consideration may be written in the following way

where  is some distance function, and  is a normalizing coefficient defined in such a way that the maximal value of  index was equal to 1. 
For definiteness in what follows we use a standard Euclidean metric, so that the polarization index is

3.1.	Three Approaches to Measure Polarization in the European Parliament
Two-dimensional polarization index

where  is the number of members of the European Parliament (MEP),  
are the respective coordinates of the MEP NOMINATE scores, and 
 is the center of mass of the system of points under consideration.
One-dimensional polarization index
The European Parliament is predominantly one-dimensional. The NOMINATE scores on the first dimension correctly predict 86% of roll-call vote decisions in the 1st European Parliament, whereas the scores on the second dimension only predict an additional 5.5% in the 1st Parliament. In this respect it seems reasonable to take into account only the first dimension when calculating polarization index.

Two-dimensional polarization index with weighted distances

where  are coefficients corresponding to the importance of the respective dimensions.  Factor 2 is used for the scaling purposes. 
We suggest to estimate  as the percent of roll-call vote decisions predicted correctly using only the first dimension, and  as the additional percent of correctly predicted votes when the second dimension is also taken into account.
Table 1 shows the discussed percentage of roll-call votes predicted correctly. Table 2 and Fig. 7 represent the values of three polarization indices discussed above.

We have also played with different values of the weighting coefficients  and  ranging  from  to  with  step. Fig. 8 shows the results. As expected, the values of polarization indices (calculated for every convocation) are convex combinations of two extreme cases: when only the first or only the second coordination is taken into account. The original multidimensional polarization index corresponds to the case .
Hence, by adjusting the coefficients  and , one can stress the importance of particular dimension when estimating polarization in the parliament.

4.	Conclusions
The extent to which the importance of the left-right and 
pro-/anti-Europe dimensions is stressed plays a significant role in the measurement of polarization in the EP
Polarization in the EP was on average lower than in the 
U.S. House of the Representatives during 1979 – 2009 when measured using two-dimensional polarization index
Two trends occur in the EP: 
1.	Party groups have become more cohesive (declining dispersion of the deputies’ positions)
2.	The ideological diversity among party groups has increased
Both mentioned trends contribute to polarization in the EP and reflect in the values of different versions of polarization index
The highest polarization was observed in the 4th EP when measured using two-dimensional polarization index and in the 5th EP when measured using one-dimensional or weighted polarization indices. The tension between the left and the right blocks was the highest at this time
The contribution of the 2nd dimension to polarization was the highest in the 3rd EP. This aligns with the fact that in this time the large group of Socialists has taken a pronounced position on the pro-/anti-Europe axis
